# General Info

This is a small project that represents different colors according to the current time, using the exact 6 digits of the ```HH:MM:SS``` time format as a hexadecimal code ```#000000```.

This small codeblock gets the current time, formats it (placing a zero before the number if it is less than ten) and then appends an # before it. That newly created hex code is then placed within the #clock element, and is set as the backgroundColor of the body. Changing the color of the background with the hex color gives the site an almost meditative feel.

Feel free to play around with the code!
